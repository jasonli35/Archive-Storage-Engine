# Archive System Project Documentation
## Overview
This project develops a robust archival storage system that ensures efficient handling and high fidelity of documents. The system is designed for adding, extracting, removing, and managing files within an archive. It now includes advanced data processing functionalities, specifically data compression and decompression, to optimize storage space and maintain data integrity.

## Project Components
### Archive Management
The Archive class is central to managing and manipulating archive files. It operates with fixed-size blocks in a binary format, optimizing space and ensuring that files are stored and retrieved without any alterations.

### Key Features
File Operations: Add, extract, remove, and list files within the archive.
Diagnostic Tools: Functionality to dump storage block details for debugging.
Data Integrity: Ensures 100% fidelity in file storage and retrieval.
Observer Notifications: Supports the registration of observer objects to notify about various operations.
Archive Creation and Access
Creating and Opening Archives: Users can create new archives or open existing ones, with files identified using the ".arc" extension.
User-Friendly Access: Simplifies the processes of starting with a new archive or accessing an existing setup.
Data Processing and Compression
The system now includes data processing capabilities, with an emphasis on file compression to enhance storage efficiency without sacrificing data integrity.

## Implemented Enhancements
IDataProcessor Interface: Supports sophisticated data operations like compression and decompression.
CompressionProcessor Class: Implements the IDataProcessor interface to handle file compression and decompression during the archival and retrieval processes.
Testing and Reliability
Comprehensive Testing: Extensive tests ensure the performance and reliability of all functionalities.
Advanced Error Handling: Robust mechanisms for addressing and managing errors enhance system stability.
Usage Scenarios
Secure Document Archival: Users can archive documents securely, ensuring they are easily retrievable without any data loss.
Data Management: Efficiently manage data by removing outdated files or listing current documents.
Optimized Storage: Compress files before archiving to maximize storage space and maintain efficiency.
System Maintenance and Debugging: Utilize diagnostic tools to maintain and troubleshoot the system effectively.
Current Implementation and Enhancements
Current Features
The system already supports basic file operations, data integrity, and observer notifications. It now also handles file compression and decompression through a well-defined data processing interface.

### Future Possibilities
Encryption and Security: Explore adding encryption functionalities to enhance data security within the archive.
Metadata Management: Implement metadata management capabilities to support enhanced indexing and retrieval of archived files.
Efficiency Improvements: Continually assess and integrate more efficient algorithms for compression and other data processing tasks.
